# SoilMoistureNitrogen
This repository contains data and codes for analyzing soil dielectric responses across a wide frequency range (kHz to GHz). The project focuses on selecting key frequencies to predict soil moisture and nitrogen levels using various machine learning and statistical techniques. The repository includes frequency selection methods, machine learning models, and evaluation tools for soil analysis.
## Variable Selection
For more information on the variable selection techniques applied in this project, please refer to my blog post [here](https://mingqianghan.github.io//posts/2024/10/variable-selection%20/).
