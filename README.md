# 🌱 Soil Property Modeling

This repository contains **MATLAB code for variable selection and prediction models** used for soil property modeling. The project focuses on analyzing soil data, selecting key variables, and building prediction models for soil properties using various statistical and machine learning techniques.

## 🔍 Overview

The code provides:

- Variable selection methods: CARS, MRMR, SPA  
- Prediction models: neural networks (used for final analysis); other models such as linear regression and SVM are available but not used for the final analysis  
- Scripts for preprocessing and analyzing soil property datasets  
- Applications for soil moisture and nitrogen prediction

The workflow includes **two stages**:  

1. **Stage 1:** Use multiple datasets from lab and field experiments for variable selection.  
2. **Stage 2:** Use information from Stage 1 for soil property estimation and testing on field data.
